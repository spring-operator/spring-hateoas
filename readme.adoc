= Spring HATEOAS

This project provides some APIs to ease creating REST representations that follow the https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HATEOAS[HATEOAS] principle when working with Spring and especially Spring MVC. The core problem it tries to address is link creation and representation assembly.

== Working with Spring HATEOAS

Since all commits are headlined with its github issue, git will treat it as a comment. To get around this, apply the following configuration to your clone:

[source]
----
git config core.commentchar "/"
----
