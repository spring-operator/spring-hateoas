== Using `@EnableHypermediaSupport`

To let the `RepresentationModel` subtypes be rendered according to the specification of various hypermedia representations types, you can activate support for a particular hypermedia representation format through `@EnableHypermediaSupport`. The annotation takes a `HypermediaType` enumeration as its argument. Currently, we support https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-kelly-json-hal[HAL] as well as a default rendering. Using the annotation triggers the following:

* It registers necessary Jackson modules to render `EntityModel` and `CollectionModel` in the hypermedia specific format.
* If JSONPath is on the classpath, it automatically registers a `LinkDiscoverer` instance to look up links by their `rel` in plain JSON representations (see <<client.link-discoverer>>).
* By default, it enables `@EnableEntityLinks` (see <<fundamentals.obtaining-links.entity-links>>) and automatically picks up `EntityLinks` implementations and bundles them into a `DelegatingEntityLinks` instance that you can autowire.
* It automatically picks up all `RelProvider` implementations in the `ApplicationContext` and bundles them into a `DelegatingRelProvider` that you can autowire. It registers providers to consider `@Relation` on domain types as well as Spring MVC controllers. If the https://github.com/atteo/evo-inflector[EVO inflector] is on the classpath, collection `rel` values are derived by using the pluralizing algorithm implemented in the library (see <<spis.rel-provider>>).
