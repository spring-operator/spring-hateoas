[[server.link-builder]]
== [[fundamentals.obtaining-links]] [[fundamentals.obtaining-links.builder]] Building links

Now we have the domain vocabulary in place, but the main challenge remains: how to create the actual URIs to be wrapped into `Link` instances in a less fragile way. Right now, we would have to duplicate URI strings all over the place. Doing so is brittle and unmaintainable.

Assume you have your Spring MVC controllers implemented as follows:

====
[source, java]
----
@Controller
class PersonController {

  @GetMapping("/people")
  HttpEntity<PersonModel> showAll() { … }

  @GetMapping(value = "/{person}", method = RequestMethod.GET)
  HttpEntity<PersonModel> show(@PathVariable Long person) { … }
}
----
====

We see two conventions here. The first is a collection resource that is exposed through `@GetMapping` annotation of the controller method, with individual elements of that collection exposed as direct sub resources. The collection resource might be exposed at a simple URI (as just shown) or more complex ones (such as `/people/{id}/addresses`). Suppose you would like to link to the collection resource of all people. Following the approach from up above would cause two problems:

* To create an absolute URI, you would need to look up the protocol, hostname, port, servlet base, and other values. This is cumbersome and requires ugly manual string concatenation code.
* You probably do not want to concatenate the `/people` on top of your base URI, because you would then have to maintain the information in multiple places. If you change the mapping, you then have to change all the clients pointing to it.

Spring HATEOAS now provides a `WebMvcLinkBuilder` that lets you create links by pointing to controller classes.
The following example shows how to do so:

====
[source, java]
----
import static org.sfw.hateoas.server.mvc.WebMvcLinkBuilder.*;

Link link = linkTo(PersonController.class).withRel("people");

assertThat(link.getRel()).isEqualTo(LinkRelation.of("people"));
assertThat(link.getHref()).endsWith("/people");
----
====

The `WebMvcLinkBuilder` uses Spring's `ServletUriComponentsBuilder` under the hood to obtain the basic URI information from the current request. Assuming your application runs at `http://localhost:8080/your-app`, this is exactly the URI on top of which you are constructing additional parts. The builder now inspects the given controller class for its root mapping and, thus, ends up with `http://localhost:8080/your-app/people`. You can also build more nested links as well.
The following example shows how to do so:

====
[source, java]
----
Person person = new Person(1L, "Dave", "Matthews");
//                 /person                 /     1
Link link = linkTo(PersonController.class).slash(person.getId()).withSelfRel();
assertThat(link.getRel(), is(IanaLinkRelation.SELF.value()));
assertThat(link.getHref(), endsWith("/people/1"));
----
====

The builder also allows creating URI instances to build up (for example, response header values):

====
[source, java]
----
HttpHeaders headers = new HttpHeaders();
headers.setLocation(linkTo(PersonController.class).slash(person).toUri());

return new ResponseEntity<PersonModel>(headers, HttpStatus.CREATED);
----
====

[[fundamentals.obtaining-links.builder.methods]]
==== Building Links that Point to Methods

As of version 0.4, you can even build links that point to methods or create dummy controller method invocations. The first approach is to hand a `Method` instance to the `WebMvcLinkBuilder`.
The following example shows how to do so:

====
[source, java]
----
Method method = PersonController.class.getMethod("show", Long.class);
Link link = linkTo(method, 2L).withSelfRel();

assertThat(link.getHref()).endsWith("/people/2"));
----
====

This is still a bit dissatisfying, as we have to first get a `Method` instance, which throws an exception and is generally quite cumbersome. At least we do not repeat the mapping. An even better approach is to have a dummy method invocation of the target method on a controller proxy, which we can create byi using the `methodOn(…)` helper.
The following example shows how to do so:

====
[source, java]
----
Link link = linkTo(methodOn(PersonController.class).show(2L)).withSelfRel();

assertThat(link.getHref()).endsWith("/people/2");
----
====

`methodOn(…)` creates a proxy of the controller class that records the method invocation and exposes it in a proxy created for the return type of the method. This allows the fluent expression of the method for which we want to obtain the mapping. However, there are a few constraints on the methods that can be obtained byusing this technique:

* The return type has to be capable of proxying, as we need to expose the method invocation on it.
* The parameters handed into the methods are generally neglected (except the ones referred to through `@PathVariable`, because they make up the URI).

[[server.entity-links]]
== [[fundamentals.obtaining-links.entity-links]] Using the `EntityLinks` interface

So far, we have created links by pointing to the web-framework implementations (that is, the Spring MVC controllers) and inspected the mapping. In many cases, these classes essentially read and write representations backed by a model class.

The `EntityLinks` interface now exposes an API to look up a `Link` or `LinkBuilder` based on the model types. The methods essentially return links that point either to the collection resource (such as `/people`) or to a single resource (such as `/people/1`).
The following example shows how to use `EntityLinks`:

====
[source, java]
----
EntityLinks links = …;
LinkBuilder builder = links.linkFor(Customer.class);
Link link = links.linkToItemResource(Customer.class, 1L);
----
====

`EntityLinks` is available for dependency injection by activating either `@EnableHypermediaSupprt` or `@EnableEntityLinks` in your Spring MVC configuration. Activating this functionality causes all the Spring MVC controllers available in the current `ApplicationContext` to be inspected for the `@ExposesResourceFor(…)` annotation. The annotation exposes which model type the controller manages. Beyond that, we assume that you follow the URI mapping convention of a class level base mapping and assume that you have controller methods handling an appended `/{id}`. The following example shows an implementation of an `EntityLinks`-capable controller:

====
[source, java]
----
@Controller
@ExposesResourceFor(Order.class)
class OrderController {

  @GetMapping("/orders")
  ResponseEntity orders(…) { … }

  @GetMapping("/{id}")
  ResponseEntity order(@PathVariable("id") … ) { … }
}
----
====

The controller exposes that it manages `Order` instances and exposes handler methods that are mapped to our convention. When youy enable `EntityLinks` through `@EnableEntityLinks` in your Spring MVC configuration, you can create links to the controller, as follows:

====
[source, java]
----
@Controller
class PaymentController {

  private final EntityLinks entityLinks;

  PaymentController(EntityLinks entityLinks) {
    this.entityLinks = entityLinks;
  }

  @PutMapping(…)
  ResponseEntity payment(@PathVariable Long orderId) {

    Link link = entityLinks.linkToItemResource(Order.class, orderId);
    …
  }
}
----
====

You can then refer to the `Order` instances without referring to the `OrderController`.


[[server.representation-model-assembler]]
== [[fundamentals.resource-assembler]] Representation model assembler

As the mapping from an entity to a representation model must be used in multiple places, it makes sense to create a dedicated class responsible for doing so. The conversion contains very custom steps but also a few boilerplate steps:

. Instantiation of the model class
. Adding a link with a `rel` of `self` pointing to the resource that gets rendered.

Spring HATEOAS now provides a `RepresentationModelAssemblerSupport` base class that helps reduce the amount of code you need to write.
The following example shows how to use it:

====
[source, java]
----
class PersonModelAssembler extends RepresentationModelAssemblerSupport<Person, PersonModel> {

  public PersonModelAssembler() {
    super(PersonController.class, PersonModel.class);
  }

  @Override
  public PersonModel toModel(Person person) {

    PersonModel resource = createResource(person);
    // … do further mapping
    return resource;
  }
}
----
====

Setting the class up as we did in the preceding example gives you the following benefits:

* There are a handful of `createModelWithId(…)` methods that let you create an instance of the resource and have a `Link` with a rel of `self` added to it. The href of that link is determined by the configured controller's request mapping plus the ID of the entity (for example, `/people/1`).
* The resource type gets instantiated by reflection and expects a no-arg constructor. If you want to use a dedicated constructor or avoid the reflection performance overhead, you can override `instantiateModel(…)`.

You can then use the assembler to either assemble a `RepresentationModel` or a `CollectionModel`.
The following example creates a `CollectionModel` of `PersonModel` instances:

====
[source, java]
----
Person person = new Person(…);
Iterable<Person> people = Collections.singletonList(person);

PersonModelAssembler assembler = new PersonModelAssembler();
PersonModel model = assembler.toModel(person);
CollectionModel<PersonModel> model = assembler.toCollectionModel(people);
----

[[server.processors]]
== Representation Model Processors

Sometimes you need to tweak and adjust hypermedia representations after they have been <<server.representation-model-assembler,assembled>>.

A perfect example is when you have a controller that deals with order fulfillment, but you need to add links related to making payments.

Imagine having your ordering system producing this type of hypermedia:

====
[source, json, tabsize=2]
----
include::{resource-dir}/docs/order-plain.json[]
----
====

You wish to add a link so the client can make payment, but don't want to mix details about your `PaymentController` into
the `OrderController`.

Instead of polluting the details of your ordering system, you can write a `RepresentationModelProcessor` like this:

====
[source, java, tabsize=2]
----
include::{code-dir}/PaymentProcessor.java[tag=code]
----
<1> This processor will only be applied to `EntityModel<Order>` objects.
<2> Manipulate the existing `EntityModel` object by adding an unconditional link.
<3> Return the `EntityModel` so it can be serialized into the requested media type.
====

Register the processor with your application:

====
[source, java, tabsize=2]
----
include::{code-dir}/PaymentProcessingApp.java[tag=code]
----
====

Now when you issue a hypermedia respresentation of an `Order`, the client receives this:

====
[source, java, tabsize=2]
----
include::{resource-dir}/docs/order-with-payment-link.json[]
----
<1> You see the `LinkRelation.of("payments")` plugged in as this link's relation.
<2> The URI was provided by the processor.
====

This example is quite simple, but you can easily:

* Use `WebMvcLinkBuilder` or `WebFluxLinkBuilder` to construct a dynamic link to your `PaymentController`.
* Inject any services needed to conditionally add other links (e.g. `cancel`, `amend`) that are driven by state.
* Leverage cross cutting services like Spring Security to add, remove, or revise links based upon the current user's context.

Also, in this example, the `PaymentProcessor` alters the provided `EntityModel<Order>`. You also have the power to
_replace_ it with another object. Just be advised the API requires the return type to equal the input type.

[[server.rel-provider]]
== [[spis.rel-provider]] Using the `RelProvider` API

When building links, you usually need to determine the relation type to be used for the link. In most cases, the relation type is directly associated with a (domain) type. We encapsulate the detailed algorithm to look up the relation types behind a `RelProvider` API that lets you determine the relation types for single and collection resources. The algorithm for looking up the relation type follows:

. If the type is annotated with `@Relation`, we use the values configured in the annotation.
. If not, we default to the uncapitalized simple class name plus an appended `List` for the collection `rel`.
. If the https://github.com/atteo/evo-inflector[EVO inflector] JAR is in the classpath, we use the plural of the single resource `rel` provided by the pluralizing algorithm.
. `@Controller` classes annotated with `@ExposesResourceFor` (see <<fundamentals.obtaining-links.entity-links>> for details) transparently look up the relation types for the type configured in the annotation, so that you can use `relProvider.getItemResourceRelFor(MyController.class)` and get the relation type of the domain type exposed.

A `RelProvider` is automatically exposed as a Spring bean when you use `@EnableHypermediaSupport`. You can plug in custom providers by implementing the interface and exposing them as Spring beans in turn.
